/// There are three types of data that is synced between the central server and the remote server:
///
/// 1) `central data`: Central data is managed by the central server and is readonly for the remote
/// server. The remote server pulls the central data on a regular basis.
/// 2) `remote data`: Remote data is managed by the remote server and is edited exclusively by the
/// remote server. The remote server pushes (backs up) the remote data regularly to the central
/// server. When a remote server instance is initialized the first time, existing remote data is
/// fetched from the central server in an "initial pull", e.g. when a remote server has been
/// re-installed and needs to fetch existing data.
/// 3) `messages`: messages are dispatched by the central server between different sites (different
/// remote servers) that are connected to the same central server. For example, a requisition
/// request from site A to site B is dispatched from site A to site B.
/// Messages are transmitted as remote data, i.e. they are pulled from the central server in the
/// same way as remote data.
/// Messages have the same data format as regular remote data and are only interpreted as messages
/// by the receiving remote server, e.g. if data doesn't belong to the local remote server it must
/// by a message.
///
/// Sync process:
/// 1) Central data is regularly pulled from the central server.
/// 2) If it is an initial remote server startup: pull existing remote data belonging to a remote
/// server from the central server.
/// After the initial pull the remote "data queue" turns into a "message queue" and messages are
/// pulled from the central server through this queue.
/// 3) Remote data is regularly pushed to the central server.
